## Abstract
In the digital age, the debate between light mode and dark mode for user interfaces has intensified. This study investigates the impact of light and dark modes on reading comprehension and memory recall through controlled experiments. Participants were tasked with reading texts in both modes and tested for comprehension and recall, while also providing personal preferences.

Keywords: dark mode, light mode, memory recall, speed reading, user interface design, user experience, memorization

## Introduction
User interface design plays a crucial role in digital technology, influencing productivity, comprehension, and user experience. The choice between light and dark modes has become a significant topic, impacting how users interact with digital interfaces. Historically, light mode has been favored for its readability and familiarity, while dark mode has gained popularity for reducing eye strain and enhancing focus.

## Related Work
Previous studies have explored various aspects of light and dark modes, including readability, visual fatigue, and user preferences. Studies like Hall & Hanna (2004), Piepenbrock et al. (2013), and Sethi & Ziat (2022) have provided insights into the advantages and disadvantages of each mode across different contexts.

## Methodology
### Participants
Twenty participants, aged 18-40, were involved in the study, with equal representation from light mode and dark mode users.

### Apparatus
Participants used a MacBook Pro with macOS, configured for light mode and dark mode. Tasks were timed using a stopwatch, and data were collected via Google Docs surveys.

### Design
A 2 x 2 within-subjects design was employed, varying mode (light, dark) and task difficulty levels. Tasks included memorization and speed reading.

### Procedure
Participants read passages in both modes and completed tasks measuring comprehension and recall. Data on task completion time and error rates were recorded.

## Results and Discussion
The study found no significant difference in reading comprehension between light mode and dark mode. However, dark mode showed lower error rates in memorization tasks. Participant feedback indicated a preference for dark mode among younger participants.

---

## Conclusion
While both light mode and dark mode have their advantages, our study suggests that dark mode may offer benefits in terms of reduced errors during memorization tasks. Preferences varied by age group, highlighting the importance of customizable interface options.
